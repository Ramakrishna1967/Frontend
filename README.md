## 🎯 What is Construct?

Construct is an **autonomous AI coding agent** that goes beyond simple AI chat assistants. Instead of answering questions, Construct **actually builds software** through a coordinated team of 5 specialized AI agents:

| Agent | Role | What It Does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 🧠 **Supervisor** | The Orchestrator | Coordinates all agents and manages the workflow |
| 🧭 **Planner** | The Strategist | Designs the implementation approach and architecture |
| 🔍 **Researcher** | The Context Gatherer | Searches patterns, best practices, and codebase context |
| 💻 **Coder** | The Builder | Writes production-quality code |
| 🛡️ **Reviewer** | The Quality Control | Finds bugs and suggests improvements before deployment |

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Real-Time Streaming
Watch the AI think and code token-by-token via WebSockets. No waiting for complete responses.

### 🧠 Context Aware  
Deep understanding of your entire codebase via Vector Database (ChromaDB) integration. It knows your patterns.

### 🔄 Self-Correcting
The Reviewer agent actively finds and fixes bugs before deployment. Quality built in, not bolted on.
